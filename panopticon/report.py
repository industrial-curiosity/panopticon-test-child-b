"""Combined PR-evaluation report: a de-duplicated TL;DR built from every check's structured
actions, shown before and after the per-check detail (pr-evaluation spec: "Combined report leads
with a de-duplicated action list").

Each check (drift.py, currency.py, merge.py) exposes its own ``collect_actions(...)`` returning a
list of ``{"kind": ..., "target": ...}`` dicts describing concrete remediation steps — never free
prose. Doc-drift and index-currency findings both emit the same ``run_doc_generation`` kind
(no ``target`` — it always means "run the whole skill once"), since panopticon-doc-generation's own
rules already keep the index current before regenerating every stale doc in one pass; de-duplication
collapses any number of these into the single line, never one line per stale doc or a separate index
line. De-duplication itself is exact dict-key matching on ``(kind, target)``, not text similarity.
