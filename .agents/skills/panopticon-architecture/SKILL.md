  Core architecture ground rules for the Panopticon project. Apply whenever

  GitHub Actions workflows, Python tooling, agent skills, OpenSpec artifacts,

# Panopticon architecture ground rules

## Repository roles

- **Template repo** (this repo, public): Python tooling, deterministic parsers,
  shared workflows, agent skills. Parsers grown in instances are contributed
  back upstream here.
- **Instance repo** ("master", private fork per org): holds `docs/{repo}/`
  copies, per-repo interface index shards, the compiled org-wide index, and
  org configuration (gating mode, workflow ref policy).
- **Child repos**: each org repo initialized by Panopticon. Owns its local
  docs and local interface index; is the authoritative source for interfaces
  it owns.

## Hybrid execution model

Deterministic Python does everything structural: init checks (the child
repo's `panopticon/config.json` is the initialization flag and holds repo
settings), index merge/compile, typed parsers, conflict detection. LLM agents are used only
where judgment is required: doc generation, doc-vs-code drift detection,
interface extraction where no deterministic parser exists, and interface
naming/matching where normalization rules are inconclusive. Never design an
LLM step for work a script can do deterministically.

Developers keep their repo's docs and local index up to date with their own
agents; CI verifies currency and fails loudly and clearly when they are
stale, so the developer knows exactly what to fix. CI agent evaluations are
scoped to what changed plus the minimal context required to understand it —
full-repo work (initial doc generation, full indexing) happens locally via
the user's agent.

## Provider-agnostic agents

An instance explicitly selects one built-in CI provider contract through the
fixed-provider `Configure Panopticon — LiteLLM`, `Configure Panopticon —
OpenAI`, or `Configure Panopticon — Bedrock` workflow; the template has no
implicit provider. Those manual entrypoints expose only provider-relevant
Actions names and share one local
configuration action for validation and persistence.
LiteLLM-compatible HTTP, direct OpenAI Chat Completions at the fixed
`https://api.openai.com/v1` endpoint, and native Bedrock Converse through GitHub
OIDC are separate reusable workflow entrypoints. The trusted provider registry
owns their workflow paths, permissions, logical inputs, and default Actions
names; instance configuration may rename secrets and variables but may not
supply an arbitrary workflow path. The OpenAI provider has no configurable
endpoint. Child bootstrap maps configured names explicitly and never uses
`secrets: inherit`.

The shared prompting, validation, correction, and retry surface remains
provider-neutral. Provider-specific authentication and transport stay inside
the selected adapter/workflow. All local actions — initialization, doc updates,
interface indexing — run through the user's preferred AI agent with the bundled
skills and need no Panopticon LLM secrets. Missing, stale, unreachable, or
incapable provider configuration fails loudly with exact instance-configuration
or child-bootstrap recovery commands; it never skips or falls back.
Shared CLI parsers may expose a consistent option surface across providers, but
must reject a non-empty provider-specific option at the CLI boundary with a
message naming the supported provider before generic configuration or writes.

Generated caller compatibility is owned by the caller renderer. Hash the
semantic reusable-workflow target, caller permissions, mappings, secrets, and
caller-supplied values, while keeping shared-workflow fallbacks outside the
caller ABI whenever GitHub can apply them before job steps run. Runtime-only
fallback changes should not require child re-bootstrap; invalidate callers
only when their rendered invocation can no longer be accepted safely.
Reusable workflow contracts SHALL declare only caller inputs consumed by the
workflow body, except for an explicitly time-bounded migration shim that is
declared optional, ignored, and covered by dispatch-level compatibility tests;
generated callers SHALL omit that shim. Renderer loading boundaries SHALL convert ordinary
renderer exceptions into the caller-renderer diagnostic before any managed
resource write; bootstrap renderer retrieval may fall back only for a 404 or
connection-level failure, never for authentication or other API failures.
Instance-owned operational controls SHALL resolve at the instance or reusable-
workflow boundary so administrators can change them without requiring child
repository maintainers to regenerate or commit callers. When a platform
evaluates a setting before instance steps run, use the organization-level
control exposed to the reusable workflow and keep legacy instance fields
migration-only rather than advertising a dead fallback.
Load, validate, and render the caller before writing any managed sync resource;
reuse that validated render for the write so renderer failures remain controlled
and cannot occur after partial sync.

When fetched Python modules execute inside a synthetic package with no filesystem
fallback, register direct dependencies in topological order before evaluating
modules that import them at module scope. Regression fixtures must use the real
module source for those imports; dependency-free fakes can hide ordering bugs.

## Sync and auth model

- Child repos **push** to the instance repo: on merge to main, docs are copied
  to `docs/{repo}/` and the repo's index shard is replaced, then the compiled
  index is rebuilt. Direct push, no PR.
- When the final merge produces conflict entries, open issues in **both** the
  instance repo and the child repo — at most one open conflict issue per
  child repo in each repository; later merges update it.
- PR workflows run a **pre-merge simulation** against the instance repo's
  compiled index and report detected conflicts as PR comments.
- PR workflows also push the PR's docs and index state to a matching branch
  named `{repo}/{branch}` in the instance repo, so in-flight branch state is
  visible org-wide. Only merges to main touch the instance repo's default
  branch.
- The default CI `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot reach the private instance repo. A
  configurable org-level token secret (`PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` by default)
  grants instance-repo read and write (PR simulation, branch pushes, merge push).
- All Panopticon secrets are org-level. Child repos never configure per-repo
  secrets or env vars — generated callers explicitly map the instance-selected
  org names to canonical reusable-workflow inputs and secrets.
- An automated child resource sync may update only its open automation pull
  request. Once that pull request is merged or closed, a later sync creates a
  new one.

## Index lifecycle

The owning repo is the source of truth. Humans may hot-fix the instance
repo's index, but such edits are temporary: the owning repo's next merge
overwrites them. Never design tooling that treats manual instance-index edits
as durable.

## Gating

Default outcomes per check type: initialization and doc-drift checks fail
the workflow when they detect a problem — the developer must know what to
fix. Interface-conflict checks are advisory by default because LLM-extracted
entries can false-positive. Orgs may adjust each check type between advisory
and blocking via instance configuration. Never hardcode outcomes; read the
gating config.

## Parser coverage growth

When the LLM extracts an interface that no deterministic parser handles, log
a warning and recommend generating a parser in the workflow summary. Parsers
are written to be upstreamable to the template repo (see
[panopticon-python-tooling](../panopticon-python-tooling/SKILL.md)).

## Documentation layers

Autogenerated per-repo docs comprise four layers: architecture overview,
per-component docs, interface docs (human-readable rendering of index
entries), and operational docs.
